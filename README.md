# Hoppers-Jam

// Developed a GUI and PTUI for CSCI 142 where we built a puzzle-solving algorithm using Breadth-First Search, an algorithm that finds the optimal path 
given a graph of nodes. The solver was made to adapt to different puzzles by recursively generating different configurations of that particular game 
and returning the shortest path. I created a fully functional graphical user interface that users could play through as well as a Plain Text User Interface.
